# About AppStudio for ArcGIS extension for Visual Studio Code

The AppStudio for ArcGIS extension for Visual Studio Code acts as a replacement for using Qt Creator. You will still use AppStudio Desktop to create new apps, but all the actions that you would have previously performed in Qt Creator, can now be completed in Visual Studio Code. You can edit, upload and run your AppStudio apps from within Visual Studio Code.

## How to use the app

Download the `appstudio-vscode-%VERSION%.vsix` file from this repo, and open Visual Studio Code. On the **Extensions** panel select the **More Actions** tool and choose to **Install from VSIX**. Select the .vsix file that you download to install. Press **Reload** in the **Extensions** panel or notification message.

Choose **Add Folder to Workspace** to browse and add your AppStudio projects to the **Explorer** panel. In the AppStudio Projects Explorer section you will see that you can run the popular AppStudio tools - **Settings**, **Upload**, **Make** and **Run** - straight from with Visual Studio Code. Code completion and context senstive help is also available to you.
